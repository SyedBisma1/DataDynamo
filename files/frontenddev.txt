Frontend development focuses on creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and visually appealing interfaces that users can interact with. Frontend developers work closely with designers to implement the visual aspects of a project and ensure that the interface is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes. They also integrate frontend code with backend systems to create dynamic and functional web applications. In addition to technical skills, frontend developers need strong problem-solving abilities and an understanding of user-centered design principles to create engaging and intuitive user experiences.
